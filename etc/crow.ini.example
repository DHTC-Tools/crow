[db]
# This section associates database logical names (DLNs) to (server/database)
# info.  The DLNs are referenced below, in [queue] and [history] sections.

# Watcher configurations: entries in [queue] and [history] sections
# are in this format:
#   source = database[, database][, interval=30]
# "source" varies for each section.  Database is a DLN defined above in [dn],
# and interval, if specified, is how many seconds should elapse between
# probes to a data source.

[queue]
# Source is "local" for the local schedd, or a hostname for a remote schedd.
# (The latter is untested, though.)
local = schedd, interval=60

[history]
# Source is a file name containing condor history records.
/var/lib/condor/spool/history = schedd, interval=30

[collector]
# Source is the hostname / pool name of a collector daemon.
# N.B. it is possible but not recommended to use the same DLN for
# a schedd queue and a collector. This is because the same job,
# retrieved from a schedd on one hand a collector on the other,
# can have overlapping but different classads.  You can do this if
# you know that's OK, but it's not a given that you want all queue
# entries stomped over by the collector entries (or vice versa).
# An easy workaround is just to define a slight variant of the DLN
# that uses a differing table name. Use one DLN when looking up
# jobs as known to the collector, and another when looking up
# jobs (perhaps the same jobs, perhaps not) as known to the schedd.
#
# A collector may possess jobs not known to the scheduler, and vice
# versa.  They are intersecting sets, but neither is necessarily a
# subset of the other.
#condor.example.com = collector, interval=90
